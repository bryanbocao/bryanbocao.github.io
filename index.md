## Research

I work on **multimodal learning (vision + IMU + Wi‑Fi FTM + text)**, **efficient machine learning** (few‑class evaluation, pruning, model selection), and **robot visual navigation** (hierarchical RL, metric learning, 3D Gaussian Splatting).

### Current focus
- Vision–wireless identity association & cross‑modal trajectory reconstruction
- Embodied navigation: representation learning and mapping
- Efficient AI/ML: Few‑class regime (benchmark tooling + dataset difficulty measurement), model pruning/merging

### Affiliations
- Ph.D. Candidate, Stony Brook University  
- Research Intern/Co‑op, Nokia Bell Labs (Jun 2021 – Fall 2025)
